# Udacity DAND Project4 - Analyze AB Test Results
Udacity Data Analyst Project 04 - Analyze AB Test Results

## Description
For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal is to work through the notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### Files
